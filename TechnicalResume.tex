\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Wildlife Computers | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
\customit{Wildlife Computers is the leading provider of advanced wildlife telemetry solutions}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote C++ firmware to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously confirms correct placement of components which allows for identification of faulty boards, improving production throughput
    \item Designed a digital isolator PCB to isolate the company's hardware from measurement devices, allowing for low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
    \item Wrote highly efficient post-processing software for a Joulescope (high precision DC energy analyzer) - calculates the Cumulative Distribution Function, Histogram, and ``Max Window" of a set of data.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Data Science Co-op}
\descript{| Control Mobile | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
\customit{Control Mobile aggregated and displayed transaction data for over 100 companies that used Stripe/Square/Paypal}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to systematically optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
    \item Worked with the agile backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and to refactor current code
    \item Fixed security issues that would leave the website vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
\end{tightemize}

\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{Autonomous Robot Competition}
\descript{| Engineering Physics \hfill}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Deployed a real-time object detection algorithm on Raspberry Pi
    \item Created signal processing software to quickly and accurately detect certain IR signals
    \item Wrote C control software and created circuits to control the mechanical subsystems
\end{tightemize}
