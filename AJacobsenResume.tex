\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{R\&D Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub | \small{Jun 2020 - Dec 2020}}
\customit{Reprogrammed the \href{https://opentrons.com/ot-2/}{Opentrons OT-2}, an open source pipetting robot for lab automation}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item Rewrote almost all the software for the robot with focus on speeding up epithelial cell growth protocols
	\item Redesigned the robot's architecture so arbitrary instruments can be used during protocols
	\item Optimized robot software for high accuracy, fast protocol execution, and protocol reproducibility
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Wildlife Computers | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
\customit{Wildlife Computers is the leading provider of advanced wildlife telemetry solutions}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote C++ firmware to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously confirms correct placement of components which allows for identification of faulty boards, improving production throughput
    \item Designed a digital isolator PCB to isolate the company's hardware from measurement devices, allowing for low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Data Science Co-op}
\descript{| Control Mobile | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
\customit{Control Mobile aggregated and displayed transaction data for over 100 companies that used Stripe/Square/Paypal}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to systematically optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
    \item Worked with the agile backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and to refactor current code
\end{tightemize}
