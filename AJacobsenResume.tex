\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{R\&D Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub | \small{Jun 2020 - Dec 2020}}
% \customit{Reprogrammed the \href{https://opentrons.com/ot-2/}{Opentrons OT-2}, an open-source pipetting robot for lab automation}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Rewrote almost all the software for the robot with a focus on speeding up epithelial cell growth protocols - new code base size is 1/4 of the original, with at least doubling of efficiency for frequent operations
    \item Redesigned computing architecture so arbitrary instruments (e.g. cell counters) can be used during protocols instead of just the Opentrons instruments
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Wildlife Computers | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
% \customit{Wildlife Computers is the leading provider of advanced wildlife telemetry solutions}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote C++ firmware to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously confirms correct placement of components which allows for identification of faulty boards, improving production throughput
    \item Designed a digital isolator PCB to isolate the company's hardware from measurement devices, allowing for low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{Data Science Co-op}
\descript{| Control Mobile | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
% \customit{Control Mobile aggregated and displayed transaction data for over 100 companies that used Stripe/Square/Paypal}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
    \item Worked with the agile backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and to refactor current code
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{12pt}


\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{Various Deep Learning Projects}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model, reinforcement learning optimized for CPU
    \item Deep Q-Network in PyTorch to play Atari's Pong, a project at the Denmark Technical University
    \item Feed-forward neural net written with Numpy solves MNIST with 97.2\% accuracy, vectorized for fast training
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{Autonomous Robot Competition}
\descript{| Engineering Physics\hfill}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Deployed a real-time object detection algorithm on Raspberry Pi
    \item Created signal processing software to quickly and accurately detect certain IR signals
    \item Wrote C control software and created circuits to control the mechanical subsystems
\end{tightemize}
