\section{Relevant Experience}

\runsubsection{Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub}
\descript{| R\&D Engineering Intern | \small{Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Present}}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Owned of the Biohub's reprogramming project of the \href{https://opentrons.com/ot-2/}{Opentrons OT-2}, an open-source pipetting robot
    \item Wrote code base with a focus on simplicity, reliability, and speed
    \item Doubled the speed of certain frequent operations (e.g. picking up / dropping pipette tips), with a reduction of the codebase size by \char`\~ 75\%
    \item Designed and implemented architecture so any software-controlled instrument can be used during protocols (e.g. cameras, GPUs, thermocyclers)
    \item Designed and implemented tests to measure the accuracy of the OT-2 using cross-correlation techniques, accurate to the µm range over the robot's movement range of \char`\~ 1 meter
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Wildlife Computers}
\descript{| Engineering Intern | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Designed an isolator PCB to isolate digital lines from sensitive measurement devices, allowing low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
    \item Wrote C++ to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously verifies PCB component placement to increase production throughput
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{Control Mobile}
\descript{| Data Science Co-op | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
    \item Worked with the backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and refactor current code
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{12pt}


\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{Deep Learning}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model written in Pytorch, optimized for multicore CPUs via multiprocessing
    \item LSTM-based Deep Q-Network, trained on Denmark Technical University's High-Performance Computing Cluster
    \item Feed-forward neural network written from scratch, implementing the math behind deep learning
    \item Currently writing a basic autograd library in Julia, in order to understand fundamentals of Pytorch
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{Engineering Physics Autonomous Robot Competition}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Designed and created an autonomous robot from scratch in 8 weeks, capable of navigating complex and dynamic course
    \item Implemented signal processing software to detect specific IR frequencies with sub-millisecond detection time
    \item Designed and created circuits to control the mechanical subsystems (robotic arm / claw, basket)
    \item Wrote (in C) driver software for the robotic arm / claw, as well as software for high-level control loops
\end{tightemize}
