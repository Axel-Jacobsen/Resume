\section{Relevant Experience}

\runsubsection{R\&D Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub | \small{Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Present}}
\customit{Owner of the Biohub's reprogramming project of the \href{https://opentrons.com/ot-2/}{Opentrons OT-2}, an open-source pipetting robot for lab automation}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote code base with a focus on simplicity, reliability, and speed - current code base has doubled the speed of certain frequent operations, with a reduction of the codebase size by \char`\~ 75\% while expanding the capabilities of the robot
    \item Designed and implemented architecture so any software-controlled instrument can be used during protocols (e.g. cameras, GPUs, thermocyclers)
    \item Designed and implemented tests to measure the accuracy of the OT-2 using cross-correlation techniques, accurate to the µm range
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Engineering Intern}
\descript{| Wildlife Computers | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
\customit{Wildlife Computers is the leading provider of advanced wildlife telemetry solutions}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Designed an isolator PCB to isolate digital lines from sensitive measurement devices, allowing low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
    \item Wrote C++ to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously verifies PCB component placment to increase production throughput
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Data Science Co-op}
\descript{| Control Mobile | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
\customit{Control Mobile aggregated and displayed transaction data for over 100 companies that used Stripe/Square/Paypal}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
    \item Worked with the backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and refactor current code
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{12pt}


\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{Deep Learning}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model written in Pytorch, optimized for multicore CPUs via multiprocessing
    \item LSTM-based Deep Q-Network, trained on Denmark Technical University's High-Performance Computing Cluster
    \item Feed-forward neural net written with Numpy solves MNIST with 97.2\% accuracy, vectorized for fast training
\end{tightemize}

\vspace{8pt}

\runsubsection{16-Week Autonomous Robot Competition}
\descript{| Engineering Physics\hfill}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Deployed a real-time object detection algorithm on Raspberry Pi
    \item Created signal processing software to detect IR signals with sub-millisecond detection time
    \item Wrote C controls software and created circuits to control the mechanical subsystems
\end{tightemize}
