\section{Relevant Experience}

\runsubsection{Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub}
\descript{| Associate R\&D Engineer | \small{Mar 2022 - Present}}
\begin{tightemize}

% I am designing, training, and deploying neural networks on an new low-cost instrument to diagnose malaria.
% Specifically, a object detection network responsible for the diagnosis, and an "autofocus" network to keep the instrument's microscope in focus.
% Along with this, I contribute to software controlling the instrument.

\item Designing, training, and deploying a custom object detection network to diagnose malaria real-time on limited compute, as well as a simple convolutional network to determine focal drift
\item Writing protocols for automated cell-splitting, including designing an algorithm to speed up aliquots
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub}
\descript{| R\&D Engineering Intern | \small{Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Dec 2021}}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Rewrote codebase of the \href{https://opentrons.com/ot-2/}{Opentrons OT-2}, an open-source pipetting robot
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed tests to measure drift of OT-2, accurate to 1 µm over \char`\~ 1 m, using cross-correlation
    \item Simplified software, reduced size by \char`\~ 60\% while maintaining previous functionality
  \end{itemize}
\item Wrote an ADC driver for a low cost luminometer to detect COVID-19 antigens, deployed in Bangladesh
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Wildlife Computers}
\descript{| Engineering Intern | \small{May 2019 – Aug 2019} }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed an isolator PCB to isolate digital lines from sensitive measurement devices, allowing low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
\item Wrote C++ to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously verifies PCB component placement to increase production throughput
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Control Mobile}
\descript{| Data Science Co-op | \small{Jan 2018 – Apr 2018} }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
\item Worked with the backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and refactor current code
\end{tightemize}
