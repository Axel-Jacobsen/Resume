R&D Engineer | Mar 2022 - Present

Involved in the creation of a revolutionary low-cost imaging cytometer for malaria detection. This device uses machine learning to diagnose malaria by imaging unstained blood samples

- Created a state-of-the-art diagnostic deep learning model for malaria detection. Achieved a detection limit below 0.00038% parasitemia, roughly 1 false positive in every 260,000 predictions. Optimized to run seamlessly at 30 FPS on Raspberry Pi 4. Currently drafting the associated research paper
- Architected and optimized software for the microscope. Key contributions include:
  - Created a multiprocessing manager to efficiently move data between processes for heavy calculations, reducing execution times from 16.3 ms to 4.8 ms
  - Enhanced data-saving speed, enabling stable operations at 30 FPS
- created a deep learning model to gauge the focus quality of microscope images, aiding in the collection of over 10 TB of data from labs globally
