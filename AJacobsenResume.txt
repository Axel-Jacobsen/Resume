Relevant Experience
-------------------

Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub
Associate R&D Engineer | Mar 2022 - Present

- Designed, trained, and deployed a extreme high-precision object detection model to diagnose malaria, with a limit of detection of 0.00043% parasitemia. Light enough to run at 30 FPS on a busy Raspberry Pi 4.
- Also

Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub
R&D Engineering Intern | Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Dec 2021

- Rewrote codebase of the Opentrons OT-2, an open-source pipetting robot
  - Designed tests to measure drift of OT-2, accurate to 1 µm over \char`\~ 1 m, using cross-correlation
  - Simplified software, reduced size by ~ 60% while maintaining previous functionality
- Wrote an ADC driver for a low cost luminometer to detect COVID-19 antigens, deployed in Bangladesh

Wildlife Computers
Engineering Intern | May 2019 – Aug 2019

- Designed an isolator PCB to isolate digital lines from sensitive measurement devices, allowing low-noise and accurate voltage measurements
- Wrote C++ to test PCBs that arrive from fabrication - autonomously verifies PCB component placement to increase production throughput

Control Mobile
Data Science Co-op | Jan 2018 – Apr 2018
- Wrote Python scripts to analyze and rank order over 300 individual SQL queries by their runtime to optimize the SQL database; reduced the runtime to fetch and display customer data by 65\%
- Worked with the backend team to fix existing bugs, write new code, and refactor current code


Projects
--------

Deep Learning
- Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model written in Pytorch, optimized for multicore CPUs via multiprocessing
- LSTM-based Deep Q-Network

Engineering Physics Autonomous Robot Competition
- Designed and created an autonomous robot from scratch in 8 weeks, capable of navigating a complex and dynamic course
- Implemented signal processing software to detect specific IR frequencies with sub-millisecond detection time
