Experience
----------

Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub
R&D Engineer | Mar 2022 - Present

We are creating a low-cost imaging cytometer for malaria diagnosis, which images fresh blood and finds malaria parasites with my object detection model (YOGO, manuscript in-progress)

- Designed and developed YOGO, a deep learning model with a limit of detection of 0.00038\% parasitemia. Reached 1680 FPS on an A100 GPU for (772, 1032) px images
- Worked on a deep learning model to predict image focus to keep the device in-focus. Successfully deployed to collect over 10 TB of data from Uganda
- Optimized microscope software, including creating a multiprocessing manager to move data between processes, reducing execution times from 16.3 ms to 4.8 ms.

R&D Engineering Intern | Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Dec 2021

- Overhauled the Opentrons OT-2 pipetting robot's codebase, reducing its size by approximately 60%.
- Authored an ADC driver for a luminometer detecting COVID-19 antigens, currently in use in Bangladesh.

Wildlife Computers
Engineering Intern | May 2019 – Aug 2019

- Designed a PCB for digital line interference protection.
- Developed C++ software for automated detection of faulty PCBs, increasing production efficiency.

Control Mobile
Data Science Co-op | Jan 2018 – Apr 2018

- Optimized over 300 SQL queries, cutting down data retrieval time by 65%.
- Conducted bug fixes, code development, and refactoring tasks.


Other
-----

Engineering Physics Autonomous Robot Competition

- Built an autonomous robot capable of navigating an obstacle course and object collection over 8 weeks.
- Composed signal processing software for IR frequency detection and subsystem control software (e.g., the robot's claw).
