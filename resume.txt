Experience
----------

Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub
R&D Engineer | Mar 2022 - Present

- Creating a low-cost imaging cytometer for malaria diagnosis, utilizing an object detection model (YOGO).
- Developed YOGO, a deep learning model with a detection limit of 0.00038% parasitemia, reaching ~1680 FPS on an A100 GPU for images of size (772, 1032) px.
- Deployed a deep learning model for image focus prediction, aiding in collecting over 10 TB of data from Uganda.
- Optimized microscope software, including creating a multiprocessing manager to move data between processes, reducing execution times from 16.3 ms to 4.8 ms.

R&D Engineering Intern | Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Dec 2021

- Overhauled the Opentrons OT-2 pipetting robot's codebase, reducing its size by approximately 60%.
- Authored an ADC driver for a luminometer detecting COVID-19 antigens, currently in use in Bangladesh.
