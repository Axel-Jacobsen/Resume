        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub</h3>
        <p class="program">R&D Engineer | Mar 2022 - Present</p>
        <p>We are creating a low-cost imaging cytometer for malaria detection. This device uses machine learning to diagnose malaria by imaging unstained blood and classifying blood cells with an object detection model</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a state-of-the-art diagnostic deep learning model for malaria detection. Achieved a detection limit below 0.00038% parasitemia, roughly 1 false positive in every 260,000 predictions. Optimized to run seamlessly at 30 FPS on Raspberry Pi 4. Currently drafting the associated research paper</li>
          <li>Architected and optimized software for the microscope. Key contributions include:
            <ul>
              <li>Created a multiprocessing manager to efficiently move data between processes for heavy calculations, reducing execution times from 16.3 ms to 4.8 ms</li>
              <li>Enhanced data-saving speed, enabling stable operations at 30 FPS</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Created a deep learning model to gauge the focus quality of microscope images, aiding in the collection of over 10 TB of data from our deployment to Uganda</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub</h3>
        <p class="program">R&D Engineering Intern | Jun 2020 - Dec 2020, Jul 2021 - Dec 2021</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overhauled the codebase of the Opentrons OT-2 pipetting robot, greatly simplifying its API and reducing its size by ~60% without sacrificing functionality</li>
          <li>Authored an ADC driver for a luminometer detecting COVID-19 antigens, currently deployed in Bangladesh. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.18.23290120v1">Link to research</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wildlife Computers</h3>
        <p class="program">Engineering Intern | May 2019 – Aug 2019</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineered a PCB to protect digital lines from interference, ensuring precision voltage measurements</li>
          <li>Developed C++ software for automated PCB component verification, boosting production efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Control Mobile</h3>
        <p class="program">Data Science Co-op | Jan 2018 – Apr 2018</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized SQL database operations by evaluating and improving 300+ SQL queries, achieving a 65% reduction in data retrieval time</li>
          <li>Collaborated with the backend team on bug fixes, code development, and refactoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Crafted an Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model using Pytorch, enhanced for multicore CPU operation</li>
          <li>Developed an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network</li>
          <li>Much surfboard repair</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engineering Physics Autonomous Robot Competition</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineered an autonomous robot in 8 weeks capable of navigating a maze and detecting IR frequencies</li>
          <li>Wrote signal processing software for rapid IR frequency detection and managed the creation of robot subsystem circuits</li>
          <li>Formulated robotic control circuits and driver software to maneuver robotic subsystems</li>
        </ul>
